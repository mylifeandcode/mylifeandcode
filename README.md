# "Hello there!"
My name is Alan Hummel and I'm a software architect and full-stack developer from the Philadelphia area. Designing and writing software is my career, but also a hobby.

### Development Philosophies
Don't repeat yourself. Follow the SOLID principles. Unit tests and code coverage are your friends. Copy/paste isn't what they meant by "code re-use".

### Technologies I Use
Angular, .NET, C#, TypeScript, Jasmine, Karma, MSTest, NUnit, Moq, SQL Server, just to name a few. :)
